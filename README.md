# Automatic-Framework

**This is a Framework made to stop you from wasting your time, It contains more than alot.** It was also created to be easy to understand and out of the way as possible. Every Function Starts with **Auto**.

It has every function I have ever used that I deemed worthy enough to be included, its ever growing and will contuine to be added to. 
[**Check out the Wiki for a very outdated list if Every Single Function**](https://github.com/SpunkyTheHedgeHog/Automatic-Framework/wiki).

I strongly recommend you to use this in combinination with **VScode**, the **Lua Server** Extention, and **Thomasims's Teardown API LuaDoc**.
You can setup the Thomasims's Teardown API LuaDoc (Which allows for Documented functions, and Autocompletion) here :
