# Automatic-Framework

This is a Framework made to stop you from wasting your time, It contains more than alot.
It has every function I have ever used that I deemed worthy enough to be included, its ever growing and will contuine to be added to. 
Check out the Wiki for Every Single Function.

Some things, mainly the UI function can be broken in some ways, I will fix them when It becomes enough of a problem to annoy me, or maybe if it is demanded enough.

I strongly recommend you to use this in combinination with VScode, the Lua Server Extention, and Thomasims's Teardown API LuaDoc.
You can setup the Thomasims's Teardown API LuaDoc (Which allows for Doccumented functions, and Autocompletion) here :
