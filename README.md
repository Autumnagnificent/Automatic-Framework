# Automatic-Framework

**A Lua framework built for Modding Teardown; A fruit smoothie of utilities and anything else that I find worthy.** It was also created to be easy to understand and out of the way as possible. Every Function Starts with **Auto**.

It has every function I have ever used that I deemed worthy enough to be included, its ever growing and will contuine to be added to. 
While all (*or should be all*) functions of the Automatic framework have lua annotations to serve as documentation, [**Bingle has made a port to represent the framework in a format similar to the Teardown API docs**](https://bingleboy.github.io/Automated-Automatic-Docs/).

I strongly recommend you to use this in combinination with **VScode**, and the **Lua Server** Extention.
You can setup the Lua-server-document (Which allows for hand documented functions, and Autocompletion) here :
